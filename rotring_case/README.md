# Roting case

This is a two-piece case for a Rotring 600 pencil.
The file dimensions are in mm and *toleranced* based on a Ultimaker 2+ printer.

For settings I used PLAL with 20% infil (although I don't think this makes much of a difference because of how thin the walls are), and a layer height of .2.
