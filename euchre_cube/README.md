# Euchure Cube

I find a significant amonut of the time when playing euchre people forget what trump is for the hand. 
This cube simply has the suits on four of its sides to keep track.

## Printing notes

I found that it printed properly (I used an Ultimaker 2+)  as oriented in the .stl with 10% infil.

## Suit images

The suits are vector images from [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/), and the images are from the authors at the following URLs:
